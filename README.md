<p id="description">Car Counter using OpenCV is a computer vision project that tracks cars in a video stream. The program is written in Python and uses the OpenCV library for image processing. It can process video streams from webcams video files and IP cameras. The program analyzes each frame of the video stream and identifies cars using edge and contour detection techniques. It includes a user interface that displays the video stream and the number of cars detected. The program can be adjusted with settings such as the sensitivity of the detection algorithm. It can be used for traffic monitoring parking lot monitoring and other applications. The program can be enhanced with deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. Running the program on WSL 2 can further enhance performance and accuracy. Car Counter using OpenCV is a powerful and versatile tool for tracking the movement of vehicles in a video stream.</p>
